    "## Environment configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two major package managers in Python: `pip` and `conda`. For this tutorial we will be using conda which, besides being a package manager is also useful as a version manager. There are two main ways to install conda: [Anaconda](https://conda.io/docs/install/quick.html) and [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to install tensorflow we recommend following the [official documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#installing_with_anaconda). In particular, for the conda installation, they advise to use pip instead of conda as the only available Anaconda package for tensorflow is not actively mantained.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the available tensorflow versions (for both Python 2 and 3 and with CPU and GPU support) can be found [in this link](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux#the_url_of_the_tensorflow_python_package). For this course we will be using: https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.3.0-cp35-cp35m-linux_x86_64.whl\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands to setup the environment are the following\n",

    "$ wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n",
