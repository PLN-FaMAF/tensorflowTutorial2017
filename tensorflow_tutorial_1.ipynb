    "For document classification we need a way to represent the documents as a numerical matrix. A commong technique to do so is by using a [bag-of-words model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model) of the documents. This technique consists in counting the number of occurring word in each document. Then it represents the document as positive integer vector where each dimension is a word in the vocabulary and shows how many times that word appeared in the document.\n",

    "of time. Generally those words have less significance in representing a document since they appear in many documents. Thus, a way of weighting the significance of the word is with [Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) (Tf-Idf). The idea is precisely to weight the word by the number of times it appear and inversely by the number of documents it appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do it, Scikit Learn has the [TfidfVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html) which given a set of documents turns them into a tf-idf matrix. In this case we decided to remove the English stopwords (words with high frequency count that doesn't add to the meaning of a document, like connectors, articles, etc.)"
