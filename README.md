# Train and visualize a model in TensorFlow

## Overview

This [PyData San Luis Argentina
2017](https://pydata.org/sanluis2017/schedule/presentation/1/) tutorial will
focus on practical aspects of implementing and training deep learning models.
We will follow, step by step, the implementation of linear and nonlinear models
with TensorFlow, focusing on the impact of tuning hyperparameters and
architectures. To keep track of results we will use the visualization tool
TensorBoard and show its functionalities.

### Objective

The goal of this tutorial is for you to learn how to build models in
TensorFlow. You will apply them to a standard document classification dataset,
and keep track of the experiments' performance with TensorBoard, a
visualization tool. 

### Who is this course aimed to?

We strongly recommend to have covered some machine learning basic concepts
previously, as we wont cover them during the tutorial:

- What is a classifier? What is a logistic regression classifier?
- Basic evaluation: metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. What is the
  train and test split for?
- What is gradient descent and what is a cost function?

## Technical requirements

This tutorial is based in [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) we uploaded
to the [Github platform](https://github.com/PLN-FaMAF/tensorflowTutorial2017).
The notebook named as [**Part 0:
Configuration**](https://github.com/PLN-FaMAF/tensorflowTutorial2017/blob/master/tensorflow_tutorial_0.ipynb)
(which can be rendered directly from Github) has all the software and data
requirements needed to configure the environment. It should be followed before
taking the tutorial in the conference.

### Software

The software packages we are using are Python 3.5 (obtained through conda)
along Numpy, Scipy, Jupyter, and the
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.3/install/) (version 1.3)
libraries. 

Please refer to the
[notebook](https://github.com/PLN-FaMAF/tensorflowTutorial2017/blob/master/tensorflow_tutorial_0.ipynb)
for detailed explanation.

### Dataset

The dataset we will use is a pre-processed version of the [20 Newsgroup
Corpus](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) for document classification.
[Part 1 of the
tutorial](https://github.com/PLN-FaMAF/tensorflowTutorial2017/blob/master/tensorflow_tutorial_1.ipynb)
is optional and explains how this dataset is obtained.  In any case it is
possible to download the dataset directly to use in Tensorflow from part 2 and
after of the tutorial.

Please refer to the
[notebook](https://github.com/PLN-FaMAF/tensorflowTutorial2017/blob/master/tensorflow_tutorial_0.ipynb)
for detailed explanation and download link.

## Structure

The Jupyter notebooks of the tutorial contain code and explanations that the
attendees can download, execute and modify during the talk. It will comprise
the following parts:

### Introduction and environment setup

This part is covered by the [Part 0:
Configuration](https://github.com/PLN-FaMAF/tensorflowTutorial2017/blob/master/tensorflow_tutorial_0.ipynb)
notebook. It has the instruction to configure the environment and download the
dataset to use.

### Dataset Preprocessing (optional)

This part is covered by the [Part 1: Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/PLN-FaMAF/tensorflowTutorial2017/blob/master/tensorflow_tutorial_1.ipynb)
notebook. It explains the dataset we are using to experiment with TensorFlow
and how we process it to have the final version ready.

### The Basics of Tensorflow

This part is covered by the [Part 2: The basics of Tensorflow](https://github.com/PLN-FaMAF/tensorflowTutorial2017/blob/master/tensorflow_tutorial_2.ipynb) notebook.
It explains the implementation of a linear model to exemplify the different
components of the TensorFlow pipeline. This includes compilation of models and
how TensorFlow is executing your code.

### Advanced Tensorflow

This part is covered by the [Part 3: Advanced Tensorflow](https://github.com/PLN-FaMAF/tensorflowTutorial2017/blob/master/tensorflow_tutorial_3.ipynb) notebook.
In this we will extend the linear model previously built into a deep neural network by
using the Layers module. During this section, we will also describe
the possible problems of training big models and how to overcome them.

### The benefits of TensorBoard

This part is covered by the [Part 4: The benefits of Tensorboard](https://github.com/PLN-FaMAF/tensorflowTutorial2017/blob/master/tensorflow_tutorial_4.ipynb) notebook.
We will present the TensorBoard interface and how we can use it to make the
experimentation process easier by collecting and visualizing the results.
